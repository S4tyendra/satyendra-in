# 🔍 Querying Entry & Exit Logs

This guide explains how to view the records of who has entered and exited the premises.

## 📺 Real-Time Monitoring
The easiest way to see recent activity is by looking at the **Entry Log** and **Exit Log** panels on the main Kiosk screen. These show the last 20 people who tapped their cards.

## 📁 Historical Data (Old Logs)
The system saves all taps into database files. These files are organized by **month** and **year**.

### 1. Where are the logs kept?
Logs are stored in: `/var/lib/iiitk-nfc/databases/`

### 2. Log File Names
- **Entries (IN)**: `in-YYYY-MM.db` (e.g., `in-2023-10.db` for October 2023).
- **Exits (OUT)**: `out-YYYY-MM.db` (e.g., `out-2023-10.db`).
- **System Logs**: `logs-YYYY-MM.db` (Contains internal system messages and warnings).

### 3. How to read these files
Since these are SQLite databases, you can open them with **DB Browser for SQLite** to see a spreadsheet-like view of all taps.

Each entry record contains:
- **TIMESTAMP**: The exact date and time of the tap.
- **STUDENT_ID**: The ID of the person who tapped.
- **CUIDV2**: A unique code for each transaction.

## 📊 Generating Reports
Currently, reports must be generated by opening the database files and exporting the data to Excel or CSV using a tool like DB Browser for SQLite.
1. Open the `.db` file.
2. Go to **File > Export > Table(s) as CSV file...**
3. Select the `entries` table and save the file.
